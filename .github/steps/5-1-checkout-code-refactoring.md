# Lesson 5 - Refactoring and Debugging Start

### :keyboard: Activity: Checkout code to refactor

In this lesson 5, you'll use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to refactor some preexisting code and debug some errors. 

But first we will need to check out some code that needs refactoring and has some other potential issues.

### :keyboard: Activity: Checkout existing branch and push to new branch for modifications

1. Checkout the branch `lesson-5-start`

2. Create a new branch off this branch called `feature/code-refactoring`. 
   
   :exclamation: IMPORTANT: Branch needs to be exactly as specified or you will not be able to continue.

3. [Optional] Run the application with `npm run start` in the root directory to test the functionality.

### Success Criteria

To complete this exercise successfully, ensure that:
   - A new `feature/code-refactoring` branch is pushed based on the branch `lesson-5-start`

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Double check that the newly pushed branch is called `feature/code-refactoring`
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems
